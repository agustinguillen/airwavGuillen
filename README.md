# AIRWAV - ECOMMERCE - React JS - CODERHOUSE

Airwav is an ecommerce platform project using React JS for frontend development and Firebase (Firestore) as database for the backend. Airwav is an idea for a fictional music store company located in La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina. On this webapp you can login using Google Authentication provider, preview the products with detail, select the products you'd like to purchase, generate a buying order that are saved within your user account.
